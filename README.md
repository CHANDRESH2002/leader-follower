This is a leader follower system using ROS 1 neotic, Gazebo 11.11.0 and Turtlebot3
Here we have implemented two approaches one by odometry data and the other by Computer vision based model
1) Leader follower system using odometry data
   Tri_formation and Two_follower_inline are the folders corresponding to this approach. each folder contains the Python code, Launch file and the URDF file.
2) Leader follower system using computer vision based approach
   Single_follower_Camera folder consists of this approach. This folder contains the Python code, Launch file and the URDF file required in this approach.
Also added the Cmakelista nd Package.xml
